            <p>
               Ron Mueck is an Australian born artist, known for his hyper realistic sculptures that range from unusually small to monumentally larger than life. Originally sculpting from fiber glass, he switched to silicone with implanted hair which adds to their realistic appearance. His sculptures are often of deeply personal content and he rarely reveals the meaning behind them.
            </p>
             <br>
            <p>
                Mueck has been creating from a young age. Having been born into a family of puppet and doll makers, he grew up with a love for creatures, costumes, and puppets which propelled him into a career in television, and film. He worked on many kids shows designing and handling puppets, and eventually began his employment with <em>Jim Henson Studios</em> where he stayed until his move into the art world in 1996. His best known work in film is the movie <em>Labyrinth</em>; a Jim Henson production with David Bowie. Mueck's talent in puppetry is well exhibited in this classic tale where he designed, handled, and voiced the beloved character Ludo.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                 Mueck's move into artistic sculpture began with a commission from his mother in law, the artist <em>Paula Rego</em>. His sculpture "Pinocchio" accompanied Paula's painting “Geppetto washing pinicchio” in an exhibition and was a success. The line of evolution from puppets to his lifelike figures pressed on and the following year he gained international attention with his controversial sculpture <a href="https://ropac.net/artists/63-ron-mueck/works/12901/" target="_blank"><strong>Dead Dad</strong></a>; his most vulnerable and emotional piece, marking the loss of his own father. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The softness and flexibility of silicone closely resembles skin and the humanness of these forms is displayed in each uniquely placed freckle, hair strand, toenail, and eyelash.
                Mueck’s artwork has been called “spooky, weird, eloquent, bizarre, shockingly real and shockingly unreal”. His work is so lifelike it is hard to resist touching it to see for yourself. Robert Rosenblum, a prominent art curator and art historian, said of Mueck, “he dares to tackle the kind of subjects avoided by most contemporary artists, namely, the timeless, universal cycles of human existence, from the womb to the tomb.” Mueck's 5-meter untitled work known as “boy” features a crouching child that fills the room, floor to ceiling. This monumental work signifies the inevitability of growing up. A human experience we are no stranger to.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Mueck's work not only feels alive but seems to “bare a soul” and is part of the reason it is so captivating. Examining his work is like catching a glimpse into the struggles of these characters' lives and making connections with them. We can see ourselves in them, relate to them, and have empathy for them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                Sometimes his sculptures take more than a year to make.  “Dark Place” took seven years to complete and successfully sets the atmosphere for emotion. It's uncomfortable, creepy, and vulnerable, but also incredible. What do you feel when you see “Dark place?” With no background or explanation of these figures, their meaning is left up to us as the viewers. But with his impeccable ability to portray emotion, their background seems less important and their emotion is the part that truly connects us to these figures. In the end, Ron Mueck's sculptures remind us that art isn't only about what we see, but about what we feel. Through the stillness of his figures, he captures the pulse of life itself...fragile, raw, and profoundly human.
