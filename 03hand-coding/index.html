            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Born in Australia in 1958, Ron Mueck began his career making puppets for children’s television, including a stint with <em>Jim Henson</em> and <em>Sesame Street</em>. Since 1996, he has devoted himself full time to his art.

            <p>
                Mueck's sculptures are all of the human figure, some unnaturally small while others are monumentally larger than life. In them he aims to capture the feeling of key moments in our passage through life. WIth their uncanny realism and minute detail, Mueck shocks us into reassessing ourselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He gained international recognition in 1997 for his sculpture <a href="https://ropac.net/artists/63-ron-mueck/works/12901/" target="_blank"><strong>"Dead Dad"</strong></a> which was part of the infamous Young British Artists Sensation exhibition, devoted to the work of young British artists, at London’s Royal Academy.
